# Momentum-Asset-Allocation-Strategy
Multi-Asset Technical Signal Backtester This Python script downloads historical price data for a wide range of assets (crypto, stocks, energy, FX) and applies technical indicators (RSI, EMA, MACD, ATR) to generate simulated buy/sell signals. It uses a simple rule-based strategy and prints all trade signals for each asset.
